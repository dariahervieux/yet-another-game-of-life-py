# About

Project represents a simple implementation of Conway's [Game of Life](http://web.stanford.edu/~cdebs/GameOfLife/) in Python 3.

The goal of the project is learning Python, so be careful, I'm a total newbe :)

# Libraries used

[numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.creation.html) to have `array` data structure and corresponding cool utility methods.

# Running unit tests

```sh
py game_of_life.ut.py -v
```

# Running the program

Not yet possible :)
